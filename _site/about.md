Jeremy F. Isnard, CFE  founded klondik.io in 2016.

Growing professionally, his strong financial analyst background and data analysis skills were the right mix to
become a skilled economic crime investigator, and quickly moved to establish his own consulting company.

As a student of the MAS ECI he wrote his master thesis about what the Paris attacks taught us about the FATF standards on Terrorism Finance ; as a statistician he co-authored a research paper published in a top-tier management journal.

klondik.io nurtures tight ties and collaborate on a regular basis with the Institut de Lutte contre la Criminalité Economique (ILCE) in Neuchâtel.
